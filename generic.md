My name is Darren (Yu) Yang.

I am an experienced software engineer with strong knowledge of computer science and 5 years' experience of programming. 

I hold a Bachelor degree in Computer Science from Tsinghua University and a Dual Master Degree in Data Science and Technology Innovation from both Tsinghua University and University of Washington. These three degrees built up my solid understanding of computer science, data science and analysis and interdisciplinary background including product management and design thinking. 

I did a software engineer internship in Microsoft Research Asia and developed the software infrastructure (including backend and frontend) for an Interactive Indoor Path Guide Application, deplyed it on Azure. The application now still serves in MSRA building No.2. 

I also did an AI (Computer Vision) Research internship in Baidu USA and proposed an optimization method to craft adversarial examples to attack deep neural network-based object detector with 100% success rate. This work has been summarized in a paper and published in the conference IEEE UEMCON 2018.
