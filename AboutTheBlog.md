This blog is where I slow down and think in public.

I write about engineering decisions, backend product design, technical leadership, and how organizations build and scale software systems. Just as often, I write about the principles behind those decisions — trade-offs, long-term thinking, and the invisible constraints that shape both systems and teams.

Recently, much of my curiosity has been drawn to the rise of AI — not just how to use models, but how to build systems around them responsibly. I'm interested in questions like how engineers can navigate the AI era, how AI changes software architecture and product design, why local inference and privacy matter, and what practical AI safety looks like in real systems.

To me, engineering is not only about correctness or performance, but about judgment — knowing what to build, what not to build, and when to change direction. The same principles often apply beyond software, in career choices and life decisions.

I believe good engineering combines rational thinking with human understanding — logical, but not detached; practical, but guided by values.
This space is a record of that ongoing exploration.

My name is Darren (Yu) Yang.

I am an experienced software engineer with strong knowledge of computer science and 5 years' experience of programming. 

I hold a Bachelor degree in Computer Science from Tsinghua University and a Dual Master Degree in Data Science and Technology Innovation from both Tsinghua University and University of Washington. These three degrees built up my solid understanding of computer science, data science and analysis and interdisciplinary background including product management and design thinking. 

I did a software engineer internship in Microsoft Research Asia and developed the software infrastructure (including backend and frontend) for an Interactive Indoor Path Guide Application, deplyed it on Azure. The application now still serves in MSRA building No.2. 

I also did an AI (Computer Vision) Research internship in Baidu USA and proposed an optimization method to craft adversarial examples to attack deep neural network-based object detector with 100% success rate. This work has been summarized in a paper and published in the conference IEEE UEMCON 2018.
