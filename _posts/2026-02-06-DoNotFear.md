Across ancient texts — the Bible, Stoic philosophy, Taoism, and Buddhism — one message appears again and again: *do not fear*.

That repetition isn’t accidental. Humans have always lived with uncertainty, change, and risk. Fear is a natural response — but it’s rarely a helpful guide for decisions.

These traditions remind us that courage isn’t the absence of uncertainty; it’s the choice to move forward without being controlled by it. When facing the unknown, calm thinking, trust in what you can control, and acceptance of what you can’t will always take you further than fear.
