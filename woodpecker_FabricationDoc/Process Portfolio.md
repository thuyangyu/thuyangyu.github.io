The project report is an **online record** of your project that is intended to be a self-explanatory description of the project concept, design goals, and implementation. You will create a website to showcase your work. You can use any free hosting service (e.g., [WordPress](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1134788/assignments/4162162), [wix.com](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1134788/assignments/4162162), or any other suitable web hosting service) to set up your site, or your own web hosting if you have that. 

This report does not have to be an extravagantly designed piece. Clear communication of your work is sufficient, although it should be **\*professional and suitable to show to an employer or client***. (If you use a WordPress or other blogging tool, make sure to **remove any irrelevant content** such as the "Archives", "Recent", "Meta", "Categories" and other default pages other tools that aren't necessary.)

The site should provide:

1. An **overview** of the project with team members' names
2. Separate pages/tabs/areas for details about member's role in the project, i.e., separate pages for the two objects.

It is **similar** in content to earlier project reports and proposals you have prepared. You can use much of the same material you submitted in your Project Proposal - no need to re-invent the wheel. Thus, you should include the following information, but the format is up to you:

- **Title**: Project title.
- **Team members:** make sure your names appear somewhere and describe each member's contributions.
- **Tag Line**: A short phrase that summarizes the project clearly and simply (this could be the WordPress site subtitle)
- **Description**: A one or two paragraph description of the purpose, intended users, design and functionality of the project.
- **System Diagram**: A simple block diagram of your project that illustrates the major hardware components of the system and how they are interfaced to the micro-controller.
- **Implementation**: A narrative description of how the system works. You should explain how the hardware and software function together to implement the interactive behavior of your design. This should be in summary form; not source code.
- **Schematics Layouts**: Diagrams of your electronic circuit. Use the software such as Fusion/Fritzing/EAGLE and show the schematic view. Include your block diagram from your project proposal.
- **Software**: You can describe the software design you used, mentioning the overall flow and approach. Include the code at the bottom of this section or page of your site. It should be readable, neatly formatted, commented (please!), and any code you did not write yourself should have attribution listed.
- **Gallery**: A collection of photographs that show your project, in overview and with some close-up details. A link to the demo video that demonstrates your system in action would be good also.
- **Video**: A video embedded into your website (of either the whole project, or a separate video for each site team. (**See details here: P8: Project Video**)
- **Links**: Optional links to any external material you would like to include in your project documentation. References or projects that you used, implemented, or modified, a process blog, etc.
- **Process**: Any observations and reflections you have about successes, challenges, delights, despairs, and the whole process.
