Submit the shape files for your project here. This consists of all of your 2D and 3D renderings of your project and early design sketches from whatever software you used to generate them (e.g., Illustrator, Rhino, Fusion, etc.)

The files should be readable, neatly formatted and with components separated into appropriate groups or layers (as needed).

You may also submit a URL if you are hosting your code on github or another repository.
