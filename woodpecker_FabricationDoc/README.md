### Woodpecker ——  Interacting Objects Proposal 

#### -by Darren Yang & Yi Fan Yin

We would like to design a woodpecker and a tree.

The woodpecker (bird) consists of a body, a button, an RGB LED, and a power source (batteries). If the woodpecker is detached (Standalone) from the tree, there is a button on the head of the woodpecker’s, once pressed, the LED inside of the body will glow. The woodpecker’s feet can be mount to the tree trunk, once mounted, the LED inside of the body will change color. The body will be made in acrylic.

The tree part consists of tree body, platform base, battery box, RGB LED lights, buttons to switch. Three buttons are designed to change the LED color of the tree. Users can use button choose different seasons for the tree, the tree will show green, yellow and white in summer, autumn and winter season. And there is a mounting point on the tree for the woodpecker. Once mounted, the tree started to display a constantly changing color together with the bird. The tree would be cut with transparent acrylic to make the tree illuminated.
