### Woodpecker ——  Interacting Objects Proposal 

#### -by Darren Yang & Yi Fan Yin

We would like to design a woodpecker and a tree.

The woodpecker (bird) consists of a body, a button, an RGB LED, and a power source (batteries). If the woodpecker is detached (Standalone) from the tree, there is a button on the head of the woodpecker’s, once pressed, the LED inside of the body will glow. The woodpecker’s feet can be mount to the tree trunk, once mounted, the LED inside of the body will change color. The body will be made in acrylic.

The tree part consists of tree body, platform base, battery box, RGB LED lights, buttons to switch. Three buttons are designed to change the LED color of the tree. Users can use button choose different seasons for the tree, the tree will show green, yellow and white in summer, autumn and winter season. And there is a mounting point on the tree for the woodpecker. Once mounted, the tree started to display a constantly changing color together with the bird. The tree would be cut with transparent acrylic to make the tree illuminated.





### Plan

##### Week1：

Your team should have several low-fidelity models of the physical form your project will be taking for inspection and critical feedback (desk crits). For the desk crit, arrange all of your prototype work products on your workbench(es) for us to review (similar to the way we reviewed previous assignments). 

Be organized and prepared to present your physical models (hand-crafted and/or machine fabricated). Make sure you are able to justify design decisions and identify potential challenges. Have your notebooks and sketches on hand for inspection.



5.0 Points Report

Fully prepared. All requirements met including, **several low fidelity prototypes**, all physical models available for inspection, **detailed sketches and design notes** in notebook. Able to **describe justifications** for design decisions. Obvious **iterations on designideas**.



3 Iteration low-fi.

Sketch, Prototype, Notes and Story.



##### Week2：

Your team should present a prototype of an interactive build of the electronic hardware of your project for inspection and critical feedback (desk crits). For the desk crit, arrange all of your two prototypes on your workbench(es) for us to review(similar to the way we reviewed previous assignments). 

Be organized and prepared to present your build and to review the code with us. Make sure you are able to justify design decisions and identify potential challenges. Have your notebooks and any schematics/sketches of your code on hand for inspection.



5.0 Points Report.

Fully prepared. All requirements met including, **two interactive prototypes (one for each object), breadboard, software and hardware available for inspection.** Able to describe justifications for design decisions.







##### Week3：

1. One Final Iteration and more
2. Presentation Prepare
3. Demo Video， Portfolio，Software/Hardware Documentation.
