Engineer. Builder. Thinker.

I'm a software engineer by profession, working primarily on backend systems, data platforms, and cloud infrastructure that support real products and real users. Much of my work focuses on designing reliable, high-throughput systems and using software to drive meaningful business outcomes.

This blog is where I slow down and think in public.

I write about engineering decisions, backend product design, technical leadership, and how organizations build and scale software systems. Just as often, I write about the principles behind those decisions — trade-offs, long-term thinking, and the invisible constraints that shape both systems and teams.

Recently, much of my curiosity has been drawn to the rise of AI — not just how to use models, but how to build systems around them responsibly. I'm interested in questions like how engineers can navigate the AI era, how AI changes software architecture and product design, why local inference and privacy matter, and what practical AI safety looks like in real systems.

To me, engineering is not only about correctness or performance, but about judgment — knowing what to build, what not to build, and when to change direction. The same principles often apply beyond software, in career choices and life decisions.

I believe good engineering combines rational thinking with human understanding — logical, but not detached; practical, but guided by values.
This space is a record of that ongoing exploration.
