### Independent Project Report

Darren Yang

##### Motivation

As the repid development of artificial intelligence, more and more people are trying to find their way to become a data scientist, an data analyst or just wanting to do something artificial intelligence algorithms related research.

What I'm going to do is to develop an easy to use product called Eastcode, which could help people to easily start coding artificial intelligent related algorithms with  intelligent and interactive user interface.

As there is a emerging need for people to write artificial intelligence code.



##### Problem

(clearly and well motivated)

##### Technical implementation

(Components of system sufficient detail)

(user interface described with input/output, screenshot)

(Other capacity: Sensor/image/sound processing)

(All overall system diagram)

effort put into technique implementation

##### Evaluation 

evaluation protocol.

findings of at least two users.

findings and their implications about what could be improved.

effort put into evaluation.

##### Reflection

A thoughtfun reflection on each topic
