#### Motivation

As the repid development of artificial intelligence, more and more people are trying to find their way to become a data scientist, an data analyst or just wanting to do something artificial intelligence algorithms related research.

What I'm going to do is to develop an easy to use product called [Eastcode](https://thuyangyu.github.io/GIX-MSTI-510-independent-project/index.html), which could help people to easily start coding artificial intelligent related algorithms with  intelligent and interactive user interface.

#### Problem

Eastcode solves problems for three group of people:

For the AI algorithm learner without strong computer-science background, Eastcode makes it easy  to start coding, and allow them only focus on algorithm itself.

For AI algorithm Engineer, Eastcode provides an easy way to do module training, it has an clear interface for them to execute parameter adjusting and view the visualization result.

For Methematician, they can test their new methematical model or new algorithms quickly with Eastcode.
